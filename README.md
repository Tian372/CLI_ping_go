# Ping CLI Application

### Zhao Tian

This repository was created for Cloudflare Internship Application: Systems.

I implemented a small ping CLI application using golang. I have never used Go before, but it was a very entertaining experience learning Go. I am definitely going to keep exploring and using Go after this application.

I took some inspiration from [sparrc](https://github.com/sparrc/go-ping), and did some modification for my task.

## Application:

You can run `./go_ping [-c count] [-i interval] [-t timeout] host`.
